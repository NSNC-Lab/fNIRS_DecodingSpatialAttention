**Abstract**: When analyzing complex scenes, humans often focus their attention on an object at a particular spatial location. The ability to decode the attended spatial location would facilitate brain computer interfaces for complex scene analysis. Here, we investigated functional near-infrared spectroscopy’s (fNIRS) capability to decode audio-visual spatial attention in the presence of competing stimuli from multiple locations.  We targeted dorsal frontoparietal network including frontal eye field (FEF) and intra-parietal sulcus (IPS) as well as superior temporal gyrus/planum temporal (STG/PT). They all were shown in previous fMRI studies to be activated by auditory, visual, or audio-visual spatial tasks. We found that fNIRS provides robust decoding of attended spatial locations for most participants and correlates with behavioral performance. Moreover, we found that FEF makes a large contribution to decoding performance. Surprisingly, performance was significantly above chance level ~1s, well before the peak of the fNIRS response. Our results demonstrate that fNIRS is a promising platform for a compact, wearable technology that could be applied to decode attended spatial location and reveal contributions of specific brain regions during complex scene analysis.
