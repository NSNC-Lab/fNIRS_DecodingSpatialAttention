1. resample
2. find # of coefficients at max level
3. half-point symmetric extension both X and Y 

4. recompute max level of decomposition using extended signal Y (whole time, i thought we're supposed to do DWT on trend itself???)
5. get coefficients up to max level and estimate power (or variance) of fBm using equation 23 in Jung's paper, using var of wavelet coefficients of Y.

6. Using same max level of decomposition as Y, apply DWT to basis X.
7. Compute universal prior distribution for all levels, normalize by its total sum and adjust scale by scale to meanP (not sure why). Will not use until later.
8. construct A matrix
9. construct weighted A matrix with covariance matrix from step 4.
10. finally, get MLE of DWT coefficients of trend, line 164 of code.
11. Split coefficients above and below J0 level and save to two different variables. Equation 20 of Jung's paper represents MLE of Wθ, not θ.
12. Perform inverse DWT on MLE of Wθ using -J0 level and remove extended segments from step 3.
13. Fixed at J0 level, compute MDL for different number of coefficients at J0 level to delete: Sort coefficients in ascending order and compute MDL as a function of total number of coefficients from level J0 to J (equation 35), the sigma squared is the var of the noise (equation 27 of Jung's paper)
14. Find and save value of minimum MDL as well as number of coefficients to delete.
15. For actual detrending, loop through channel
